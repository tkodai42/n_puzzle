NAME
     echo -- write arguments to the standard output

SYNOPSIS
     echo [-n] [string ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The echo utility writes any specified operands, separated by single blank (` ') charac-
     ters and followed by a newline (`\n') character, to the standard output.

     The following option is available:

     -n    Do not print the trailing newline character.  This may also be achieved by append-
           ing `\c' to the end of the string, as is done by iBCS2 compatible systems.  Note
           that this option as well as the effect of `\c' are implementation-defined in IEEE
